Everybody ready?

OK.

00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,281
All righty, then.

What?

- My sweet, brave Bobbie.

11
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,695
No one sees your pain,
no one but me.

12
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,763
- Oh.

13
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,331
- No, come on, come on.

14
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,534
- Gabby, remember how, like,
ten minutes ago,

15
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,502
I told everybody that

16
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,871
now was not the time
to be grieving my daddy?

17
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:40,440
- I do.
I marveled at your strength.

18
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,176
- And the best way that we
could honor his memory

19
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,478
is by remembering
what he told us.

20
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,115
People come to Happy's Place
to leave their troubles behind.

21
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,752
So let's go out there and show
them the smiles on our faces,

not the...
both: Tears in our eyes.

23
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,423

Oh, see what you do to me?

[sobs]

28
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,167

Hey, can I get you
something to drink?

30
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,337
- I'm not sure.

31
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,571
I'd love something
for my nerves,

32
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,573
but I'm worried
it's a little early.

33
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,608
- What you need is
some Tennessee coffee.

34
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,210
- What's that?

35
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,145
- Whiskey.

36
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,613
- Sounds good.

- Oh, nice to meet you.

40
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,486
- Likewise.

41
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,521
- So you're a little nervous?

42
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,357
Let me guess.

43
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,225
Somebody's been
ghostlighting you.

44
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,327
That's what you kids say,
right?

45
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,197
- I think you mean gaslighted
or ghosted.

46
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,266
And no, I'm waiting on someone,
but he's running a little late.

47
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,170
- Mm. So you're worried
you're being floundered.

48
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,271
- I don't know what that means.

49
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,473
- Yeah, well, it's pretty new.

50
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,808
Probably haven't heard
of it yet.

51
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,776
- Go do something over there.

52
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,644
- Yep.

53
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,580
- So who's this guy
making you wait?

54
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,515
- I got this phone call
from an attorney

55
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,384
and he said it was
really important,

56
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,253
but that he couldn't tell me
any more except in person.

57
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,689
So I'm like, why not?
[laughs]

58
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,725
I mean, it's crazy, but
it's kind of fun, too, right?

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,761
- I wouldn't think so, no.

60
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,396
Sounds sketchy to me.

61
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,730
So no more coffee for you

62
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,699
until he gets here
and I can check him out.

63
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,868
- OK.
Well, can I have tea, then?

64
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,471
And by that, I mean gin.

65
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:22,275
So I'm sorry, but did I hear
your father just died?

66
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,843
- I hope so.
We buried him.

Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

- Oh, no, no, no.
It's perfectly fine.

70
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,685
He would have loved that joke.

71
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,521
Yeah, he was a great man.

72
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,556
- Must be hard.

73
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,725
- Yeah, I miss him like crazy,
but I'm blessed.

74
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,227
Not many daughters get to spend
as much time with their daddies

75
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,229
as I did.

76
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,732
- I envy you.
That sounds...

77
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,567
[sighs] Amazing.

78
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,401
- Yeah.

79
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,338
- Hey, Bobbie,
I've got the papers.

80
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,906
Can we meet in your office?
- You got it, Jim.

81
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,275
Nice to meet you, Isabella.

82
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,843
- Wait, you're Isabella?

83
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,911
Great.

84
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,546
I'm Jim Jackoway.
I called you.

85
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,414
I'm meeting with you, too.

86
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,719
- Well, this is weird.
[chuckles]

87
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,490
Are you sure
I'm supposed to be here?

88
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,792
- I'm sure Jim will
explain everything.

89
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,861
- I know this is odd,

90
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,731
but there's been a little
hiccup with Happy's will.

91
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,466
And Isabella, you're here

92
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,268
because you two
share something in common.

93
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,036
- What's that?

94
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,805
- A father.

95
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,474
You're sisters.

96
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,476
both: Wait, sisters?

97
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,346

I've just got to handle
a little piece of business.

106
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,673
Coffee.
I need coffee, quick.

107
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,774
- Oh, yeah. OK.

108
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,908
- Not coffee-coffee!

109
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,510
- Sorry!

110
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,746
- OK.

111
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,517
- What happened in there?
You look whiter than usual.

112
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,618
- I thought we were gonna
read Daddy's will.

113
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,953
Jim said there was a hiccup,
Isabella's my sister,

114
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,388
and I must have blacked out,

115
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,624
'cause I have no idea
how I got out here.

116
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,060
- Wait, he's saying
Happy had an affair?

117
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,796
- And that woman
is his daughter?

118
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,997
OK, that is so not right.

119
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,465
- I know.

120
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,802
- I mean, I would kill
to be your sister!

121
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,037
Why couldn't your dad have
cheated with mymom?

122
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,073
- [sighs] I'm shocked!

123
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,841
I mean,

124
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,410
I didn't think Daddy could
ever do anything like this,

125
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,578
'cause he always said that

126
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,914
family was
the most important thing.

127
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,850
- Maybe that's why
he started two of them.

00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,466
- This is so weird.

133
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,768
I mean, I know I said
that before, but it is.

134
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,069
It's weird.

135
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,204
Don't you think this is weird?

136

- Well, I used to practice
in Florida, so not really.

137

keep you waiting.

I shouldn't just
take stuff off your wall.

141
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,855
It's just everything in here

142
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,458
all of a sudden has
so much more meaning.

143
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,627
- Daddy hung my drawings
there himself.

144
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,162
- These are yours?
- Uh-huh.

145
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,864
I was five.

146
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:35,135
A lot of folks thought it was
the work of a seven-year-old.

147
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,037
- You know,
I majored in psychology,

148
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,005
and they say that you can
tell a lot about a person

149
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,575
by what they draw, even
something they did as a child.

150
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,145
It's like a key to
getting inside their head.

151
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,813
- [chuckles uncomfortably]
Really?

152
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,981
[chuckles]

153
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,618
Well, don't go looking in here,
'cause nothing to see.

154
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,987
And by that I mean I'm normal.
[laughs]

155
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,754
Oh, would you not sit there?

156
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,523
- Oh.
- That's Daddy's chair.

157
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,625
- Sorry. I didn't realize
that'd bother you.

158
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,760
- Of course it bothers me.

159
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:01,828
- It does?

160
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,630
- I mean, that's not weird,
right?

161
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,864
I mean, there's a lot
of people that

162
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,468
don't like people sitting in
their dead relatives' chairs.

163
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,904
That's totally normal.

164
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,572
- Uh-huh.

165
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,741
- OK, I'm not usually this way.

166
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,810
I mean, I'm the sane one
in the bunch.

167
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,011
Just ask anybody.

168
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,780
Everybody else is a little
cock-a-doodle-doo, but not me.

169
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,949
No, sir, I got to tell you
that right now.

170
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,484
Not me.
[laughs]

171
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,186
You're getting in my head,
aren't you?

172
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,055
- Bobbie, I understand

173
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,224
this is a lot to take in.

174
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,693
Your father passed away,

175
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,563
your emotions are raw
and fragile, and--

176
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,898
and then out of nowhere,
here I am,

177
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,101
a sister that you didn't even
know you had.

178
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,535
- It is a lot, isn't it?

179
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,537
- Of course it is.

180
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,573
And I'm processing it, too.

181
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,476
Not quite like you are,
but that's OK.

182
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,777
- Thank you.

183
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,446
- I just want to say

184
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,117
it's important at times like
this to take care of yourself.

185
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,719
And no judging...

186
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,256
I can smell alcohol
on your breath.

187
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,492
- Hey, you were out there
drinking, too.

188
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,993
- You kind of forced it on me.

189
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,230
- OK, that's--that's not--
I was--

190
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,065
OK, I'll stop drinking.

191
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,500
- All we have left to do

192
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,036
is to have both of you
sign these papers.

193
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,237
- What are they?

194
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,572
- Well, as Happy's other child,

195
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,575
he's giving you co-ownership
of this tavern.

196
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,811
You and Bobbie are
gonna be partners.

197
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,945
both: What?

198
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,247
- Are you serious?

199
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,948
Did you hear that?

200
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,084
- Yeah.
Yeah, I heard that.

201
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,786
[chuckles]

202
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,688
It looks like I'm
gonna start drinking again.

203
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,660
.

204
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,294
- It's all happening so fast.

205
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,165
I thought Daddy's death was
gonna be my big life crisis,

206
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:49,169
and it's only third
on the list this week.

207
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,806
Why did it have to happen
right when he's gone?

208
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,675
I know it's happening
because he's gone.

209
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,279
You don't have to get
so snarky about it.

210
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,147
I just need time.

211
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,183
Time to miss him, you know?

212
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:07,320
It's so hard to grieve and
be mad at him at the same time.

213
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,822
So I'm just gonna
put my head down,

214
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,056
stick to my schedule,

215
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,826
and let God and time
sort it out.

216
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,030
Did that answer your
original question?

217
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,100
- I asked if you could
order more cheese.

218
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,668
- [chuckling] Yeah, cheese.

219
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,635
Well, like I always say,

220
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,637
if you don't want
to hear about my problems,

221
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,806
don't ask me about cheese.

222
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,944
I'm out.

223
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:40,120
- [laughs nervously]

224
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,722
Could you please
stand somewhere else?

225
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,826
And maybe breathe
less aggressively?

226
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,095
- See, Steve has a thing
about germs.

227
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,698
He doesn't like people
standing too close.

228
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,667
Or touching his stuff.

229
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,701
- Please do not do that.

230
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,103
- Oh, oh, I can't--

231
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,838
boop!
- Ah.

232
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,174
[disinfectant spray hisses]

233
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,176
- OK, you know,
I'm just gonna touch it again.

234
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,887
Touché.

235
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,223
- So sounds like
you have a little OCD.

236
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,393
- Oh, no, I got a lot of it.

237
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,928
But I'm working on it.

238
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,996
- That's really--
- [laughs nervously]

239
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,732
I can still feel your breath.

240
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,267
- Sorry.
[chuckles softly]

241
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,868
It's just that I noticed that

242
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,970
you're doing the accounting
for the bar

243
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,005
at the bar.

244
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,106
[chuckles]

245
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,107
- Oh, boy.

246
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,709
You're gonna make that
a problem, aren't you?

247
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,743
- No, no--
- Bobbie!

248
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,945
Bobbie, come in here, please!

249
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,380
- All right, what's going on?

250
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,415
- The hiccup is attacking me!

251
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,019
- [gasps]
I was just curious.

252
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:49,422
I mean--I mean, it is a little
odd he's doing his work here.

253
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,057
- No.

254
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,693
See, it's only odd because
you're paying attention to it.

255
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,029
If you don't think about it,
it's fine.

256
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,197
- What?
- That's true.

257
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,432
And if you want to help
an odd person,

258
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,768
Gabby's right over there.

259
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,010
- I'm not trying
to help people.

260
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,778
I-I just want to know
how things work.

261
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,912
- Oh, that's something

262
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,081
you really don't need
to worry about.

263
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,383
- Um, yeah, I do.

264
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,752
I own half the bar
and I have the right to know.

265
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,053
- Oh, really?

266
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,721
Well, I've been running
this place for ten years.

267
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,690
I earned that right.

268
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,859
- I never had the chance
to earn it.

269
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,427
Who knows how many
opportunities I've been denied

270
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,429
that I didn't even know about?

271
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,032
- Preach it, sister.
[chuckles]

272
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,935
I feel like I have been denied
opportunities just like you.

273
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,739
- Well, you're a white woman,
but y-yeah, OK.

274
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,341
- If you love
analyzing people so much,

275
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,144
why don't you start out
in personnel, then?

276
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,346
Poke around in
everyone else's heads?

277
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,347
- Not me!

278
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,349
- Not Emmett!

279
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,217
- Fine.
I'd love that.

280
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:54,921
And you'll see
I'm gonna make a difference.

281
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,990
- You really want her
messing around with personnel?

282
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,492
- No, but owning a business
seems like a hoot

283
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,627
when you're just dreaming.

284
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,163
It's dealing with the details
that'll drive you crazy.

285
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,166
- Yeah, but she's gonna
be dealing with us.

286
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,034
- [laughs] Exactly.

287
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,804
[upbeat country music]

288
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,006
- The new girl seems nice.

289
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,008
I mean, a little young.

290
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,110
Kind of a know-it-all.

291
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,447
Difficult to be friends with.

292
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,849
But nice.

293
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,217
- I like her.

294
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,385
She has kind eyes.

295
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,321
- Oh, gag!

296
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,156
You like everybody.

297
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,791
- No, I don't.

298
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,793
I mean,
I like people in general.

299
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:34,894
A lot of them.

300
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,463
Most, even.

301
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,131
Dang it, you're right.

302
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,500
[chuckles softly]
I like everybody.

303
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,535
- Hey, you guys.
You on a break?

304
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,404
- Yes, but it's OK.

305
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,072
Bobbie lets us sit here.

306
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,541
We used to sit out back,
but then I saw a raccoon, so--

307
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,477
[gasps softly]

308
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,545
- Actually, my break's over.

309
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,080
- Oh.
- Sorry.

310
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,917
- Takoda didn't leave
because of me, did he?

311
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,052
- Oh, no, no.

312
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,820
He's just shy
around the ladies.

313
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,022
Playa got no game.

314
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,494
- Do you have a minute to talk,
or is your break over too?

315
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:09,996
- Both.

316
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,564
What's on your mind?

317
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,567
- Well...

318
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,136
I think too often,

319
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,171
employees feel like
they don't have a voice.

320
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,907
So I want you to know that
if there are any problems

321
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,977
that you want to talk about,
I'm here.

322
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,514
- Now that you mention it...

323
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:31,117
I have been kind of lonely.

324
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,118
- Oh.

325
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:36,389
I meant problems with work,
but go--go ahead.

326
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,424
- It's just--[sighs]

327
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,827
You know, I thought that when
Happy, you know--

328
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,228
[imitates croaking]

329
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,129
- [clears throat]

330
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:45,265
- That Bobbie was gonna
need a friend.

331
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:48,034
And that she would finally
turn to me.

332
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,136
I mean, her husband is gone,
her daughter is deployed,

333
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,572
so I should
be her natural go-to.

334
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,407
Should I be lying on a couch
for this or something?

335
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,077
- [laughs] That--

336
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,046
that's not really what
we're doing here.

337
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,248
So how can I help?

338
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,385
- Could you leave
and never come back?

339
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,553
- Excuse me?

340
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,355
- I can't compete
with a sister.

341
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:11,057
I mean, don't you have someone
to go back to?

342
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,059
- I don't really have anyone,
no.

343
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,528
- A mother?
Boyfriend?

344
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,064
You at least have to have cats.

345
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,599
- Well, this kind of

346
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,301
complicates things
with my mother.

347
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:24,170
And I just got out
of a relationship,

348
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,073
but I haven't told him yet.

349
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,909
- Great.

350
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,246
I'm screwed because
your life's a mess.

351
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,281
- Can I tell you something
really personal?

352
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:40,920
- Really?

353
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:41,955
- Yeah.

354
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,523
- [chuckles softly]

355
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,527
[giggling]

356
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,995
I don't know why I'm giggling.

357
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,063
I, um--it's just
that nobody ever--

358
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,098
OK, go on.
Mm-hmm.

359
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:56,269
- I'm not very good
at relationships.

360
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,505
I have a lot of trust issues.

361
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,206
- Really?

362
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,276
- Well, it's hard not to when
your own dad doesn't want you.

363
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,546
I didn't even know he existed.
[scoffs]

364
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,449
So I totally understand
how you feel, Gabby.

365
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,484
'Cause I feel lonely, too.

366
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,220
We're both just looking
for a connection.

367
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,127
- I would kill
to be your sister.

368
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,563
[upbeat music]

369
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,098
* *

370
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:29,002
A-ha! [laughs]

371
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,136
- What are y'all doing?

372
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,104
- Isabella said that

373
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,073
we could use your office
as a new break room.

374
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm not so sure about this
chair, though, you know?

375
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,476
This--ah.

376
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,444
- I like this one.

377
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,447
I can see why
you're always sitting in it.

378
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,049
- So Isabella said y'all
could be in here, right?

379
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,084
- Yeah, yeah.
Isn't that sweet?

380
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,352
- Super sweet.

381
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,620
Out!

382
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,190
- Red thunder, red thunder.

383
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,157
- Isabella, what do you think--

384
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,158
- I need to talk to you.

385
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,160
- What?
Now?

386
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,963
But I'm all revved up,
and I don't want to waste it!

387
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,034
Suddenly you feel
the need to talk?

388
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,204
The man who congratulated me
on my ten-year work anniversary

389
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,506
by giving me a thumbs up?

390
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,208
- Why are you being
so hard on her?

391
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,744
You've always said a good idea
can come from anyone.

392
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,613
- I meant anyone I agree with.

393
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,115
- This isn't like you.

394
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,516
- Well, I've got
a lot going on.

395
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,319
Or have you forgotten
our cheese talk?

396
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,088
- Everyone who works here
bugs you in some way,

397
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,324
but you look past that
and make it work

398
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,493
because you are a good person.

399
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:31,164
You need to go out
and try that with her.

400
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:35,168
- It's not fair, you
complimenting me when I'm mad.

401
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,771
Fine, but I liked you better
when you didn't talk.

402
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,273
Oh, shut up.

403
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,245
I was reminded
that I'm a good person,

404
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,782
so I'm willing to listen
to your ideas.

405
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,450
- Wow, thanks.

406
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,451
- But just keep in mind,

407
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,386
everything around here
is working just fine.

408
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,122
- Maybe for you,
because you're in control.

409
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,390
And you keep that control

410
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,526
by closing that door
and shutting everyone out,

411
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,661
when all they want to do
is be there for you

412
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,296
and with you.

413
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,033
Just like me, all they want
is to be included.

414
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,672
- Nah, they're good.

415
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,742
- If you're so sure about that,
why don't we ask them?

416
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:16,810
- You mean like a vote?

417
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,411
How exciting.

418
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,680
There was a time
I wasn't legally allowed to.

419
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,315
It's a long story.

420
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,651
- It's your jobs.
You should have a say.

421
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:27,253
You can pick me and changes
like the break room,

422
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,156
or Bobbie
and the way things are.

423
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,391
- That just sounds like

424
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,227
someone's feelings
are gonna get hurt.

425
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,496
- Blah, blah, blah.
Let's do this thing.

426
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,498
Everybody get a pen and paper
and write down

427
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,301
who you support,
me or Isabella.

428
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,502
Emmett!
- No.

429
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,704
- Emmett's out.

430
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:46,139
OK, it's just you guys.

431
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,508
- My pen is missing.

432
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,610
- Oh, I got it.

433
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,281
- I abstain.

434
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,617
- That just leaves you two.

435
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,222
OK. [sighs]

436
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,659
"I choose you both,"
and a smiley face.

437
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:11,097
- [chuckles]
I wonder whose that is.

438
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,867
- Well, that just leaves Gabby.

439
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,869
Good old, sweet Gabby.

440
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:19,673
[laughs and sighs]

441
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,878
Isabella.
- [gasps]

442
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,446
- I'm sorry.

443
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,115
She won me over
with her friendliness.

444
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,351
You know I'm not used to that!

445
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:34,754
- Fine.

446
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,790
Congratulations, Isabella.

447
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,291
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, come on.

448
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,759
Don't be like that.

449
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:41,761
So you have to put up
with a few changes.

450
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,129
Big deal.

451
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,599
- It is a big deal.

452
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,436
Everything here
means something to me.

453
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,637
That bass?

454
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,506
Me and Daddy caught it
in Hillside Lake.

455
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,741
That window?

456
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,510
Me and Daddy picked it up on
a trip together in Nashville.

457
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:02,182
His chair, everything here
says me and Daddy!

458
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,383
- No kidding.

459
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,918
You know what it doesn't say?

460
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,821
Me.
Once again, I'm left out.

461
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,322
- Well, that's not my mistake,

462
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,925
and I shouldn't be the one
who has to pay for it.

463
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,494
[door opens and slams]

464
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:19,265
- I really shouldn't
be allowed to vote.

465
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:27,407
.

466
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,174
- Can this wait?
I'm taking a break.

467
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,914
- Think you'll want
to hear this.

468
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,183
I'm leaving.

469
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,686
- Why?
You got what you wanted.

470
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,454
- No, I didn't.

471
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,323
I was hoping to find a place
where I belonged,

472
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:47,560
but there's nothing of me here.

473
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,330
There's no pictures of me.
[sighs]

474
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,700
None of my drawings
are on his wall.

475
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:01,474
I've wasted too much of my life
not feeling wanted,

476
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,810
so why should I fight so hard
to stay in a place

477
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,478
that just confirms it?

478
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,416
- Safe travels.

479
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,484
We should keep in touch.
- Really?

480
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:15,588
- Well, I'm sorry, but this is
too painful for the both of us.

481
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,591
You look at me, and you see
the father you wish you had.

482
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:25,899
And when I look at you, I lose
the father I thought I had.

483
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,301
- Then I guess it's settled.

484
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,402
[glass shatters]

485
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:32,739
Oh, I am so sorry!

486
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,674
Oh!
Oh.

487
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,675
Oh, my gosh.

488
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,980
What?
What is it?

489
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,850
- It's your name.

490
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,853
This drawing is yours.

491
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,856
- It's mine?

492
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,958
It's my drawing.

493
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,927
This is my drawing.

494
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,862
He had my drawing on his wall!

495
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,364
- Yeah, he did!

496
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,900
Feel free to take it with you
when you leave!

497
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,670
- Wait.
But this changes things.

498
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,408
- Yeah, it does.

499
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,979
You know, I thought all
this was just a big mistake,

500
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,614
but it's not.

501
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,316
[sighs]

502
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,386
He cared for you,
and he wanted us to be

503
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,688
together for some reason.

504
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,759
I guess we owe it to him
to try to find out why.

505
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,361
- I'd like that.

506
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,662
Can I give you a hug?

507
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,630
- I don't think--

508
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:31,664
oh!

509
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,504
- You know, growing up,
I always wanted a big sister.

510
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,506
And now I've got one!
- [chuckles uncomfortably]

511
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,074
- Even if she is old enough
to be my mom.

512
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,576
- [laughs]

513
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,812
Oh, honey, this is Tennessee.

514
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,382
I'm old enough
to be your great-grandma.

515
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,385
[upbeat music]

516
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,621
* *

517
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,324
I'm still mad at you.

518
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,364
But I still love you.

519
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,533
You cheating turd.

520
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:11,404
I've got so many questions.

521
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,473
So if you're looking down,

522
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,409
I'd really appreciate it
if you'd send someone

523
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,346
to help me sort all this out,
'cause I'm lost.

524
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,614
- I heard a sad voice.

525
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,819
- Haven't you had
enough fun today?

526
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,387
